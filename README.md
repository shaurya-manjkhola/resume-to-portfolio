# Resume to Portfolio Agent

Upload a resume (PDF or DOCX), pick a visual theme, and get back a complete,
responsive portfolio website — generated from the resume's content, not just
a reformatted copy of it.

**Live demo:** https://resume-to-portfolio-ht4q.onrender.com

## How it works

1. **Parse** — `core/parser.py` extracts raw text from the uploaded PDF or DOCX.
2. **Generate** — `core/generator.py` sends that text to Gemini, which structures
   it into a `PortfolioProfile` (name, headline, bio, experience, projects,
   education, certifications, volunteer work, skills) and expands thin bullet
   points into real narrative, without inventing facts that aren't in the resume.
3. **Render** — `core/renderer.py` turns the structured profile into a full
   responsive HTML page, styled according to the theme picked (`aurora`,
   `terminal`, `sunset`, or `studio`).
4. **Share** — `core/storage.py` persists the chosen profile and theme in
   Postgres under a stable slug, so the generated site stays live at a
   permanent link (`/p/{slug}`) instead of expiring with the session.

## Setup

**Requirements:** Python 3.10+, a Postgres database (a free instance from
[Neon](https://neon.tech) or [Supabase](https://supabase.com) works).

```bash
git clone git@github.com:shaurya-manjkhola/resume-to-portfolio.git
cd resume-to-portfolio
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
DATABASE_URL=your_postgres_connection_string_here
```

Get a Gemini key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey).
`DATABASE_URL` is the connection string your Postgres provider gives you,
including `sslmode=require`. The `portfolios` table is created automatically
on startup if it doesn't already exist.

## Running it

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Open **http://localhost:8000**. Pick a theme, upload a resume (`.pdf` or
`.docx`), and submit. Preview every theme against the same parsed data, then
finalize one to get a permanent shareable link at `/p/{slug}`.

## Sample input / output

- Sample input resume: `samples/test_resume.pdf`
- Sample generated output: `samples/sample_output.html`

## Project structure

```

## Notes

- Themes: **Aurora** (dark, gradient), **Terminal** (dark, monospace), **Sunset**
  (light, warm/editorial), **Studio** (light, muted/serif).
- If a resume has no education section, education is omitted from the
  generated site rather than shown empty. Same applies to certifications and
  volunteer work.
- Generation runs Gemini with a fallback chain (`gemini-2.5-flash` →
  `gemini-1.5-flash` → `gemini-1.5-pro`) in case a model is unavailable.
- Shareable links are stable across restarts and deploys — the profile and
  theme are stored in Postgres, not on local disk.
- If two people share a name, the slug gets a random numeric suffix on
  collision rather than overwriting the earlier link.
